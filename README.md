# Netflix Data Analysis

Data is derived from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/shivamb/netflix-shows?select=netflix_titles.csv) with which the following two tasks are performed.

1. Build and visualize an ontology for the dataset.
2. Group different movies using text and clustering algorithm. Use the clusters to build a classification model.  

Some points discovered were that,

1. The average number of minutes that is streamed by a viewer is about 90 minutes.
