## Ontology Of Netflix Data

Ontology is a formal and explicit specification of concepts and relationships that can exist for objects present in our data. To create the ontology, we ave used the software Protégé editor with the use of VOWL Plugin.

The basic scenarios chosen were - 
1. Viewer watches the movie
2. Director directs the movie

Both Viewer and Director fall into the Module 'Person' while the type os movies each of them watch or direct falls into the module 'Type'. 

Object properties such as watches/directs are created to assign their relations to one another. Data properties such as cast. director, rating related to movies/TV shows represent the value of the entities. All the objects are connected based on creating individual identities and providing them with object and data properties.
